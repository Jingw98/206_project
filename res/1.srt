1
00:00:00,745 --> 00:00:07,304
Move it, damn it!

2
00:00:08,446 --> 00:00:10,469
Stay there, you little punks!

3
00:00:11,814 --> 00:00:17,270
Wait till I get my hands on you!

4
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:20,547
You, bastard!

5
00:00:20,568 --> 00:00:21,034
Yes? Jung Tae-soo speaking.

6
00:00:24,972 --> 00:00:29,429
How have you been?
It's Miran here.

7
00:00:33,142 --> 00:00:34,608
It's been a long time.

8
00:00:37,643 --> 00:00:39,007
I trust you're well.

9
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:56,505
Wang-jae passed away
this morning...

10
00:03:34,826 --> 00:03:40,158
Hey, you, some dry snacks over
here, huh. Don't forget the beer.

11
00:03:40,294 --> 00:03:43,455
Hey, bring some eats
to the folks over there.

12
00:03:43,595 --> 00:03:44,754
That reminds me.

13
00:03:44,895 --> 00:03:47,656
If not you,
who'd take care of all this.

14
00:03:47,795 --> 00:03:49,762
With Wang-jae gone and everything,

15
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:52,658
Miran would've had to do
everything herself.

16
00:03:52,797 --> 00:03:54,854
What are you talking about?

17
00:03:56,198 --> 00:03:58,461
Before Wang-jae was

18
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,662
my little sister's husband,
he was my friend, you know?

19
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,267
We were family!

20
00:04:08,501 --> 00:04:12,230
You're straight up,
that's what I like about you.

21
00:04:12,369 --> 00:04:18,133
That's why I always talk
so highly of you.

22
00:04:18,271 --> 00:04:19,635
The way I see it.

23
00:04:22,171 --> 00:04:26,037
When I said I wanted to sit
for the exams,

24
00:04:26,173 --> 00:04:28,935
Wang-jae was the only one
who helped me.

25
00:04:29,574 --> 00:04:31,336
Who dare say I'm wrong!

26
00:04:32,775 --> 00:04:34,657
Frankly, who here didn't
point a finger at me.

27
00:04:34,658 --> 00:04:36,538
Every one of you goddamn guys!

28
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:40,541
Let it go, Dongwan...
You're drunk.

29
00:04:40,677 --> 00:04:45,407
Drunk? You call someone
telling the truth drunk?

30
00:04:46,446 --> 00:04:50,208
Hey, Pil-ho.

31
00:04:50,346 --> 00:04:53,109
Wang-jae shouldn't have
been the one to die.

32
00:04:54,147 --> 00:04:56,808
But the stinking assholes
sitting around here!

33
00:04:56,949 --> 00:04:59,211
You dumb stupid idiot.

34
00:04:59,349 --> 00:05:00,713
Hey! Hey!

35
00:05:00,849 --> 00:05:04,215
If you're wasted, go home.

36
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:07,413
- And take a nap you idiot.
- Look here.

37
00:05:07,551 --> 00:05:10,609
Let go. A guy like this has got to
get straightened out a bit.

38
00:05:10,752 --> 00:05:13,513
Let go, let go. Look.

39
00:05:15,053 --> 00:05:18,078
For god sakes,
he's your older brother.

40
00:05:23,922 --> 00:05:27,582
Everybody just go on back to
what you were doing.

41
00:05:29,023 --> 00:05:31,582
God damn it, it left a mark.

42
00:05:31,725 --> 00:05:32,883
Let go.

43
00:05:36,626 --> 00:05:38,889
Is this the way of a funeral house?

44
00:05:51,197 --> 00:05:55,152
The joint's small,
but Wang-jae's prized it.

45
00:05:55,297 --> 00:05:58,753
What's this?
Bring out some good stuff.

46
00:05:58,899 --> 00:06:00,762
I'm on it, can't you see?

47
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,763
Just when he said
he was settling down...

48
00:06:07,001 --> 00:06:10,059
In any case, how've you been?

49
00:06:11,302 --> 00:06:13,268
How I been, how you think I been?

50
00:06:13,402 --> 00:06:15,369
A cop chasing the bad guys
as usual.

51
00:06:17,204 --> 00:06:21,364
You mean you're still resorting to
deadly force to get confessions?

52
00:06:21,505 --> 00:06:24,132
You obviously don't know
the lengths

53
00:06:24,273 --> 00:06:28,229
to pull cuffs round a punk
these days.

54
00:06:28,373 --> 00:06:31,432
Interrogation rooms are a joke,
a real joke.

55
00:06:33,275 --> 00:06:37,436
Looks like Korea's finally
one of the elites, huh?

56
00:06:37,576 --> 00:06:42,635
Like them American TV shows,
they bring in all sorts of

57
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:47,234
fancy shrinks to put you
on the ringer?

58
00:06:47,379 --> 00:06:52,540
When Columbo said it all,
am I wrong?

59
00:06:54,181 --> 00:06:58,410
That's enough of the small talk.

60
00:06:58,549 --> 00:07:00,412
Whatever was it that
happened to Wang-jae?

61
00:07:08,751 --> 00:07:10,809
What happened blows me away.

62
00:07:14,653 --> 00:07:19,110
You heard the gist of it.
It happened right here.

63
00:07:20,855 --> 00:07:26,220
The help skipped and
Wang-jae ran the shift himself.

64
00:07:26,356 --> 00:07:31,984
Business was jumping though
it only was a weekday.

65
00:07:32,725 --> 00:07:33,884
Couple more beers here please.

66
00:07:34,025 --> 00:07:36,584
Yeah, I'll be right there.

67
00:07:37,026 --> 00:07:43,790
<i>After his mother died and</i>
<i>Miran had the miscarriage,</i>

68
00:07:43,928 --> 00:07:46,895
<i>He tried hard to pull it all together</i>

69
00:07:47,629 --> 00:07:50,495
<i>after he got out.</i>

70
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:56,294
<i>Heard some kids were causing</i>

71
00:07:56,431 --> 00:07:58,294

<i>it happened.</i>

72
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,829
<i>You should know since
you're a detective, but</i>

73
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:07,858
<i>damn kids don't fear
nothing these days.</i>

74
00:08:08,002 --> 00:08:10,264
<i>Scares the damn shit</i>
<i>out of me, them kids.</i>

75
00:08:11,103 --> 00:08:13,762
<i>Older folks know better,</i>
<i>but these kids.</i>

76
00:08:13,903 --> 00:08:17,564
<i>They got no idea</i>
<i>who Oh Wang-jae is.</i>

77
00:08:17,704 --> 00:08:19,670
Wait till I get my hands on you!

78
00:08:19,804 --> 00:08:22,270
- Your ass is mine!
- That's enough!

79
00:08:22,405 --> 00:08:24,463
That's enough, I said!

80
00:08:24,605 --> 00:08:28,164
Don't, don't touch me!

81
00:08:30,608 --> 00:08:35,268
<i>Should've taken a deep breath</i>
<i>then and dropped it.</i>

82
00:08:35,409 --> 00:08:37,638
Trash the stinking place!

83
00:08:39,177 --> 00:08:40,143
That's enough!

84
00:08:40,277 --> 00:08:41,937
<i>You know how Wang-jae could be...</i>

85
00:08:42,077 --> 00:08:44,441
<i>Ran after them outside,</i>

86
00:08:44,578 --> 00:08:46,340
Stay there you little punks!

87
00:08:46,479 --> 00:08:49,344
<i>thinking he'd teach 'em a lesson.</i>

88
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,346
<i>But no champion stays</i>
<i>that way for ever.</i>

89
00:08:57,382 --> 00:08:59,644
<i>No matter what</i>
<i>he might've been before,</i>

90
00:08:59,782 --> 00:09:03,739
<i>he wasn't the Wang-jae of old.</i>

91
00:09:16,654 --> 00:09:19,018
God damn little peckers.

92
00:09:32,558 --> 00:09:34,821
Are you ready?
Go outside!

93
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:36,323
Why?

94
00:09:36,459 --> 00:09:41,324
We're taking a family portrait today.

95
00:09:43,628 --> 00:09:49,085
Whoever it was that beat up
your brother

96
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:52,287
sure gave him a chestnut for an eye.

97
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:54,488
Probably had it coming to him.

98
00:09:54,631 --> 00:09:58,291
Whatever it is, he's still
your brother. Right?

99
00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:02,595
If he only plays right just
half his part,

100
00:10:02,733 --> 00:10:05,393
you wouldn't have to
worry about such things.

101
00:10:05,534 --> 00:10:07,563
Frankly, who do we have to thank for

102
00:10:07,564 --> 00:10:09,592
having to live cooped
up like this, huh?

103
00:10:09,735 --> 00:10:12,792
He's pulling us all down with his
wet dreams of being a damn scholar.

104
00:10:12,936 --> 00:10:14,903
What more have we got to do for him?
Now that he's pissed away everything.

105
00:10:15,037 --> 00:10:16,560
Quiet! He'll hear.

106
00:10:17,604 --> 00:10:19,468
Yeah, I know sir.

107
00:10:19,605 --> 00:10:22,663
Of course, sure, but

108
00:10:23,505 --> 00:10:26,564
we could really use you up here!

109
00:10:26,706 --> 00:10:32,470
Listen up. Cover for me
just a few days, alright? What?

110
00:10:32,608 --> 00:10:35,371
You forgot already that

111
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:38,567
I was stuck in the car
eating <i>ramen</i> for a week,

112
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:39,573
when you had your kid?

113
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:41,973
Why are you digging up
that story now?

114
00:10:42,111 --> 00:10:43,770
My hands are tied up,
don't you see?

115
00:10:43,911 --> 00:10:45,844
Look, whatever it is
you've got going on,

116
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:47,776
I'll see you in Seoul
in exactly one week.

117
00:10:47,912 --> 00:10:49,844
Captain's shitting on
people all over the place.

118
00:10:49,979 --> 00:10:54,346
Well, let him do what he wants.
Gotta go battery's low.

119
00:10:54,481 --> 00:10:58,846
Got no idea! You take care of it!

120
00:11:19,688 --> 00:11:22,349
<i>1987, A high school Fall picnic</i>
Go! Go!

121
00:11:25,356 --> 00:11:27,323
How far you going!

122
00:11:27,857 --> 00:11:29,016
Heh?

123
00:11:34,859 --> 00:11:36,017
What's this?

124
00:11:37,659 --> 00:11:40,126
This stuff is snake good snake.

125
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,022
No better medicine for a man.

126
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:44,627
Where'd you get that?

127
00:11:45,362 --> 00:11:50,920
Trapped the slimy bastard
some feet down there.

128
00:11:51,063 --> 00:11:52,529
Bottled it right there myself.

129
00:11:52,663 --> 00:11:55,426
What you waiting for? Pop it open!

130
00:11:55,565 --> 00:11:59,793
You dumb hick.
Not any good to chug it now.

131
00:11:59,932 --> 00:12:02,297
This gets better the longer
you keep it buried.

132
00:12:03,033 --> 00:12:05,693
On this day we shall bury it.

133
00:12:05,834 --> 00:12:06,993
Don't anybody touch it!

134
00:12:08,135 --> 00:12:11,693
And in about 20 years or so...

135
00:12:11,835 --> 00:12:15,099
After we all make it big,
we open it with style.

136
00:12:16,437 --> 00:12:18,802
Alright by me,
since it's good for that.

137
00:12:18,937 --> 00:12:21,404
If it's that good,
I can wait even longer.

138
00:12:23,138 --> 00:12:24,695
Hey, Wang-jae!

139
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,806
Wang-jae!

140
00:12:31,207 --> 00:12:32,469
What's going on?

141
00:12:55,714 --> 00:13:01,081
# Like the wings of a pigeon
# flying the blue sky,

142
00:13:01,216 --> 00:13:05,843
# our spirits soar to the skies above.

143
00:13:06,384 --> 00:13:08,044
- Hey!
- # We all laugh together,

144
00:13:08,185 --> 00:13:12,050

Where we headed to!

151
00:13:51,863 --> 00:13:53,830
Oh man! Show 'em!

152
00:13:53,964 --> 00:13:59,330
# Like the countless stars in

# Oh, friends forever!

# Hey, happy life!

00:14:31,642 --> 00:14:33,199
Run.

159
00:14:33,842 --> 00:14:35,603
Don't sweat it,

160
00:14:35,742 --> 00:14:39,107
life's full of funny surprises.

161
00:14:41,443 --> 00:14:43,069
Whatever happened there anyway?

162
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:45,644
My brother was acting
up like a stupid idiot in

163
00:14:45,645 --> 00:14:47,576
front of all them boys
from Onsung High school.

164
00:14:48,812 --> 00:14:50,472
Sorry guys.

165
00:14:51,114 --> 00:14:53,171
No need for that.

166
00:14:54,514 --> 00:14:58,971
A future justice of the peace
shouldn't be resorting to fist fights.

167
00:14:59,116 --> 00:15:03,379
You're gonna save all our skins
later on anyways. That's that then.

168
00:15:04,417 --> 00:15:08,373
But I really gotta take a leak.

169
00:15:09,218 --> 00:15:11,082
How we getting out?

170
00:15:11,219 --> 00:15:13,879
You twit.

171
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:17,953
Just yell for help to the voices
down there.

172
00:15:18,087 --> 00:15:19,644
And embarrass up to death?

173
00:15:19,788 --> 00:15:21,049
Then what?

174
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:28,253
Just sing for your lives.

175
00:15:29,491 --> 00:15:34,049
# Baby come back

176
00:15:35,692 --> 00:15:40,751
# Blame it all on me I wish
you were here

177
00:15:41,594 --> 00:15:45,755
# Waiting.

178
00:16:56,014 --> 00:16:59,176
Just a second. Tae-soo, say hello.

179
00:16:59,316 --> 00:17:01,874
He's a detective from Seoul.

180
00:17:06,317 --> 00:17:08,375
Got anything for me to do?

181
00:17:08,518 --> 00:17:09,779
What?

182
00:17:09,918 --> 00:17:12,078
Gotta start looking now.

183
00:17:12,219 --> 00:17:13,775
For what?

184
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,977
For what? To get the bastards
who cut up Wang-jae.

185
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,484
What you gonna get?

186
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:21,985
You'll stir up more shit
than anything.

187
00:17:22,121 --> 00:17:24,179
Damn town's noisy

188
00:17:24,323 --> 00:17:26,482
as hell as it is.

189
00:17:27,023 --> 00:17:31,252
Tell me. I just heard you say
what you did.

190
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:33,653
It's not just anybody
we're talking about. It's Wang-jae.

191
00:17:36,292 --> 00:17:38,054
You don't think I'm pissed?

192
00:17:40,493 --> 00:17:42,357
You don't think I'm fucking pissed?

193
00:17:43,194 --> 00:17:45,752
He was my best friend,
best fucking friend!

194
00:17:45,895 --> 00:17:49,556
I said he was my best friend,
you idiot, best friend!

195
00:17:49,697 --> 00:17:52,254
Nobody's pissed more than me,
nobody!

196
00:17:54,097 --> 00:17:56,564
But there's a time for everything,

197
00:17:56,699 --> 00:17:57,960
everything!

198
00:17:59,098 --> 00:18:02,157
Well, I was never any good
at keeping time,

199
00:18:02,299 --> 00:18:05,425
but I'm just gonna skin whoever
put it to Wang-jae.

200
00:18:05,567 --> 00:18:07,533
Hey, hey!

201
00:18:08,268 --> 00:18:10,235
What's with him now?

202
00:18:11,269 --> 00:18:12,633
It's nothing.

203
00:18:12,769 --> 00:18:14,735
That moron.

204
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:17,527
Let's walk down.

205
00:18:20,871 --> 00:18:24,134
How about you?
Going back today?

206
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:29,638
No matter how I look at it,
Something's not in place.

207
00:18:30,674 --> 00:18:34,937
I want to see Wang-jae's case
closed myself.

208
00:18:35,076 --> 00:18:38,406
What you worried about
when I'm here?

209
00:18:40,143 --> 00:18:44,100
You don't have the law on your side.

210
00:18:46,545 --> 00:18:49,603
Catching bad guys is what I do.
Remember?

211
00:18:56,948 --> 00:18:59,506
Did Wang-jae act strange lately,

212
00:19:00,949 --> 00:19:02,210
that had you notice?

213
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:05,609
This is snake booze, snake booze.

214
00:19:08,051 --> 00:19:09,779
Doing something
he ain't done before...

215
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:11,680
Aren't you going to Seoul?

216
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:16,381
It's a simple homicide
of a petty mobster.

217
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:20,887
Though you may think otherwise,
detective.

218
00:19:21,022 --> 00:19:22,488
Hey, Miran!

219
00:19:22,622 --> 00:19:24,179
You know that's not the case.

220
00:19:43,395 --> 00:19:44,758
Tell me just one thing.

221
00:19:46,095 --> 00:19:50,655
Did Wang-jae really
get himself clean?

222
00:19:54,497 --> 00:19:57,260
Hey, give me Wonsuk's number.

223
00:19:57,399 --> 00:20:00,160
Uhm, he hasn't been
around these days...

224
00:20:10,502 --> 00:20:14,367
Yeah, nothing so far, huh?

225
00:20:14,503 --> 00:20:19,527
Yeah, drop by here
after you're done.

226
00:20:23,573 --> 00:20:27,233
Mr. Jang, whatever
kept you so long?

227
00:20:27,973 --> 00:20:29,133
My apologies.

228
00:20:30,174 --> 00:20:34,937
Now where were we?

229
00:20:35,075 --> 00:20:36,337
I believe it was
the special tourism license.

230
00:20:37,576 --> 00:20:39,133
Ah yes, the special license.

231
00:20:40,076 --> 00:20:43,135
So the Onsung
Tourism Bill is now law

232
00:20:43,278 --> 00:20:45,835
- and all that's left is letting people know.
- That's right.

233
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:48,343
And we've got the casino license.

234
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:53,502
You did well to get us here.

235
00:20:53,647 --> 00:20:54,806
Thank you.

236
00:20:54,948 --> 00:20:56,608
But this is only the beginning.

237
00:20:57,148 --> 00:20:59,512
Brought this up with you last year...

238
00:20:59,648 --> 00:21:01,012
Yes.

239
00:21:01,149 --> 00:21:05,105
This casino business isn't
child's play, you know.

240
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:08,411
Getting the license don't solve
all problems.

241
00:21:09,652 --> 00:21:12,413
We can't starting construction,
because

242
00:21:12,552 --> 00:21:14,314
we haven't been able to get
the road permit.

243
00:21:14,453 --> 00:21:19,113
Mr. Jo, I've been on it day
and night the last month...

244
00:21:23,123 --> 00:21:28,284
Don't tell me you've been doing
your best.

245
00:21:29,724 --> 00:21:34,987
Everybody tries and does his best,

246
00:21:35,126 --> 00:21:36,887
but there's only two kinds of people.

247
00:21:37,025 --> 00:21:39,083
Those who does the job
and those who don't.

248
00:21:40,827 --> 00:21:44,987
Why else would I send you my
four best people from Seoul?

249
00:21:46,628 --> 00:21:48,492
Do you understand me?

250
00:21:50,229 --> 00:21:53,890
If the road permit doesn't come
soon, matters will get difficult here.

251
00:21:56,698 --> 00:21:59,859
- Sir, how are you?
- Got a delivery?

252
00:21:59,999 --> 00:22:01,363
- Go on, then.
- See you.

253
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,059
Hey!

254
00:22:04,199 --> 00:22:05,461
Oh, what brings you here?

255
00:22:05,601 --> 00:22:09,863
Came out because I missed
you dearly.

256
00:22:10,001 --> 00:22:11,467
Busy?

257
00:22:11,602 --> 00:22:13,660
Wish I was.

258
00:22:14,903 --> 00:22:18,267
Shall we splash around
in a sauna, then?

259
00:22:18,404 --> 00:22:22,168
Sauna?
Sauna sounds good.

260
00:22:23,005 --> 00:22:29,929
# We met worldly world

261
00:22:30,074 --> 00:22:35,338
# What is your hope?

262
00:22:35,476 --> 00:22:38,340
Which one first, the pinky
or the thumb?

263
00:22:38,476 --> 00:22:41,341
Which one? Pinky? Thumb?

264
00:22:41,477 --> 00:22:42,840
Start with the thumb.

265
00:22:42,977 --> 00:22:47,139
Guess it don't matter much
which goes first.

266
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:48,643
Look here now, Jang.

267
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:50,939
I'm the chairman of
the Youth Federation.

268
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,138
Landlord Jang.

269
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,940
You've made your point!

270
00:22:55,081 --> 00:22:57,343
How about doing the tongue first?

271
00:22:57,481 --> 00:22:59,948
Can't concentrate
because of the noise.

272
00:23:00,083 --> 00:23:02,242
That's rushing it a bit, no?

273
00:23:02,382 --> 00:23:04,315
Why you booked up today?

274
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:08,214
Jang. I'll square up with you.

275
00:23:09,251 --> 00:23:11,718
You know I'm the only heir.

276
00:23:11,852 --> 00:23:15,513
How can the only grandson ever
turn his back on his hometown?

277
00:23:15,653 --> 00:23:20,314
Wait. How about taking
the whole hand?

278
00:23:20,455 --> 00:23:21,512
Can I?

279
00:23:21,655 --> 00:23:25,315
Mr. Jang! Don't forget who backed
you to reach what you are today!

280
00:23:27,056 --> 00:23:30,511
How about going with the heel?

281
00:23:31,158 --> 00:23:41,391
The heel is much more troubling.

282
00:23:42,326 --> 00:23:45,488
Yeah? Go for it then.

283
00:23:45,629 --> 00:23:46,788
Alright.

284
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:59,196
Mr. Jang. You take my land,
I got nowhere to go.

285
00:24:01,333 --> 00:24:04,595
Humming a song should help a bit,
right?

286
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:08,894
Who was that again
at the secret service,

287
00:24:09,001 --> 00:24:11,560
grounding everything and feeding
it to the chickens?

288
00:24:11,702 --> 00:24:14,168
This is humanistic compared
to that monster.

289
00:24:18,104 --> 00:24:21,662
Why is it then that you take me
as a fool?

290
00:24:27,107 --> 00:24:28,367
Mr. Jang!

291
00:24:30,207 --> 00:24:33,663
You win, you win.

292
00:24:36,708 --> 00:24:38,971
You baking a cake in there,

293
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:41,373
bitch, get out here!

294
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:43,938
I'm coming, I'm coming!

295
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:46,438
Let's go.

296
00:24:47,879 --> 00:24:50,640
Oh my god, what're you doing?

297
00:24:50,779 --> 00:24:52,837
What bitch? Shoot!

298
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:56,538
Hey, what's going on?
Someone come in?

299
00:24:56,681 --> 00:24:58,238
Been waiting for me?

300
00:24:58,382 --> 00:25:03,145
You actually take a shit too?

301
00:25:03,283 --> 00:25:06,546
Blow off, OK,
can't you see I'm busy?

302
00:25:06,684 --> 00:25:08,741
So when are they coming?

303
00:25:09,485 --> 00:25:11,644
- Who's they?
- Who they.

304
00:25:11,785 --> 00:25:14,843
All your hard-working stiff
boyfriends.

305
00:25:14,986 --> 00:25:17,817
How the hell should I know that?

306
00:25:17,954 --> 00:25:21,717
Don't get mad at me or anything.

307
00:25:22,254 --> 00:25:26,518
Boozing it up every night
gives you the runs, don't it?

308
00:25:26,657 --> 00:25:28,816
Hey, diarrhea girl, look here.

309
00:25:28,957 --> 00:25:31,116
- You wanna be internet famous?
- Hey, you totally nuts?

310
00:25:31,257 --> 00:25:33,019
Stop it!

311
00:25:33,158 --> 00:25:35,021
I don't know anything!

312
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:38,319
- Good resolution.
- Crazy bastard.

313
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:41,915
Ok for underage girls to work
these days?

314
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:44,527
Can't even go near booze

315
00:25:44,662 --> 00:25:46,526
as far as I know.

316
00:25:48,162 --> 00:25:52,493
- Hey! Hey! You sick bastard!
- Bidets are popular these days.

317
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:54,759
Don't know? For real?
Still don't know?

318
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,787
You sick dog, stop it.

319
00:25:55,831 --> 00:25:57,195
Alright, alright.

320
00:25:57,331 --> 00:26:00,594
- What? You gonna tell me something?
- I'll tell you.

321
00:26:02,532 --> 00:26:06,899
Heard he's hiding out somewhere
in downtown.

322
00:26:07,035 --> 00:26:08,591
Pissed off!

323
00:26:33,608 --> 00:26:37,167
Hey you! Don't complicate things.

324
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:39,469
Just answer the questions.

325
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:43,373
Who the hell are you, a pig?

326
00:26:45,412 --> 00:26:46,571
Pig?

327
00:26:47,712 --> 00:26:52,373
I wanted this to be civilized,
but you don't let me.

328
00:27:13,186 --> 00:27:15,345
Think you remember
a bit better now?

329
00:27:15,487 --> 00:27:16,544
Yes, yes!

330
00:27:45,162 --> 00:27:47,219
Be careful!
You'll hurt yourself.

331
00:30:58,115 --> 00:31:01,173
Don't you even have uncles,
you idiots?

332
00:31:44,594 --> 00:31:46,151
- No, no!
- Grab the rope!

333
00:31:46,295 --> 00:31:47,455
The rope!

334
00:32:25,172 --> 00:32:30,800
Who the hell are these kids anyway?

335
00:32:30,941 --> 00:32:33,203
You should know better than me.

336
00:32:37,142 --> 00:32:42,805
You've been away too long.

337
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:47,306
This ain't the same Onsung
you know.

338
00:32:49,446 --> 00:32:51,924
Came back after a
decade and find my

339
00:32:51,925 --> 00:32:54,402
ass kicked by a bunch of kids, damn it!

340
00:32:56,747 --> 00:32:59,612
Right after Wang-jae
washed his hands clean

341
00:32:59,748 --> 00:33:02,682
and handed everything
over to Pil-ho,

342
00:33:02,817 --> 00:33:11,479
there was suddenly all this talk
about a casino coming to town.

343
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:18,878
Should've kept quietly to it instead
of breaking his back with a bar.

344
00:33:22,022 --> 00:33:24,283
Wang-jae and Pil-ho get along OK?

345
00:33:24,822 --> 00:33:27,880
Friends are friends no matter what.

346
00:33:28,524 --> 00:33:30,990
Wang-jae would take care of things

347
00:33:31,123 --> 00:33:33,886
with whatever Pil-ho couldn't fix.

348
00:33:34,025 --> 00:33:37,856
They never brought me in
on any of it.

349
00:33:40,093 --> 00:33:42,560
Sukhwan don't be a soldier no more.

350
00:33:43,194 --> 00:33:45,160
I'll have a talk with the local
chapter.

351
00:33:45,294 --> 00:33:50,455
What? Be real, will you.

352
00:33:50,596 --> 00:33:53,859
What?
What are you going to do, huh?

353
00:33:55,098 --> 00:33:58,155
Put yourself in his shoes
for a second.

354
00:33:58,298 --> 00:34:01,857
The man we're all indebted
to died like a dog.

355
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,465
You want me to do nothing? Huh?

356
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,965
It's killing me too!

357
00:34:07,101 --> 00:34:09,431
At least you guys were
around him all along.

358
00:34:09,568 --> 00:34:10,727
How about me?

359
00:34:12,169 --> 00:34:14,931
Know how it feels to come home
after 10 years

360
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:17,434
to see your friend
in a goddamn morgue?

361
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:18,729
Huh?

362
00:34:21,472 --> 00:34:22,732
Shit!

363
00:34:27,373 --> 00:34:31,431
After Donghwan squandered all
we had,

364
00:34:32,574 --> 00:34:34,837
there was only Wang-jae
to help him out.

365
00:34:36,976 --> 00:34:42,001
And it was only Wang-jae
who looked out for me

366
00:34:42,143 --> 00:34:45,406
when I was running into it bad.

367
00:34:48,346 --> 00:34:49,710
But what are you?

368
00:34:50,646 --> 00:34:54,603
I gotta make Wang-jae rest in
peace.

369
00:34:54,748 --> 00:34:56,008
Sukhwan.

370
00:35:03,149 --> 00:35:08,913
Hey can you trace up
those kids' ladder?

371
00:35:38,426 --> 00:35:41,586
Hey, who came down from
Bonjungdong yesterday?

372
00:36:49,078 --> 00:36:51,545
Let go, you asshole!

373
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,146
Ouch! What are you doing?

374
00:36:55,247 --> 00:36:59,704
Bring me up! I'll tell you!

375
00:36:59,849 --> 00:37:03,509
I'll tell you goddamn it!

376
00:37:18,655 --> 00:37:21,018
What are you guys doing here?

377
00:37:28,056 --> 00:37:29,682
You sick useless bastard!

378
00:37:29,823 --> 00:37:32,586
Think about your mother, you...

379
00:37:32,725 --> 00:37:34,986
- You bastard!
- Hey!

380
00:37:35,125 --> 00:37:37,388
You're not my brother, you bastard.

381
00:37:40,726 --> 00:37:42,989
I thought something was strange.

382
00:37:43,527 --> 00:37:45,585
Got no bitch
and always stayed home,

383
00:37:45,728 --> 00:37:49,491
- but always pinching around.
- It's not that, that's not how it is!

384
00:37:49,629 --> 00:37:51,687
If not that then what, what?

385
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:58,589
Hey, Dong-wan, Dong-wan!

386
00:37:58,732 --> 00:38:00,391
Look at me.

387
00:38:00,931 --> 00:38:04,660
Dong-wan! Look me in the eye.

388
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,358
Hey, Tae-soo.
Really I didn’t know.

389
00:38:08,501 --> 00:38:12,765
Promised me dope
if I named some loose kids.

390
00:38:14,202 --> 00:38:18,159
But I didn't know
that was going to hurt you.

391
00:38:18,304 --> 00:38:22,066
I'm a son of a bitch
if I did that on purpose.

392
00:38:25,606 --> 00:38:28,767
Who made you like this?

393
00:38:30,007 --> 00:38:32,769
Mr. Jang, isn't this too much?

394
00:38:33,908 --> 00:38:36,636
Go over the terms of the contract.

395
00:38:37,576 --> 00:38:41,235
Pledged property is surrendered

396
00:38:41,376 --> 00:38:46,243
when full repayment is not made
by given date.

397
00:38:46,378 --> 00:38:49,038
That's not what you said

398
00:38:49,179 --> 00:38:52,340
when you lent me the money.

399
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,946
How much more generous can I be?

400
00:38:55,081 --> 00:38:58,139
Frankly my rates were better
than a bank's

401
00:38:58,282 --> 00:39:00,747
and I let slide
countless missed payments.

402
00:39:00,882 --> 00:39:04,839
Everybody knows the land price
is going to jump.

403
00:39:04,984 --> 00:39:10,816
So we'll sell when high and
pay back your money.

404
00:39:10,952 --> 00:39:13,918
I'm going to go with
what the contract says.

405
00:39:16,253 --> 00:39:18,117
You bitch's son!

406
00:39:18,254 --> 00:39:22,210
You think it's a secret

407
00:39:22,355 --> 00:39:25,913
what you got up your dirty sleeve,
heh?

408
00:39:26,855 --> 00:39:29,618
Why you all throwing fits now, huh?

409
00:39:29,757 --> 00:39:31,621
You all think you're sitting
on a gold mine?

410
00:39:31,758 --> 00:39:33,916
You fools!
Why'd you borrow my money?

411
00:39:34,058 --> 00:39:36,423
Robbers of the worst kind,
all of you!

412
00:39:36,959 --> 00:39:37,720
- Throw them the hell out!
- You son of a bitch!

413
00:39:37,859 --> 00:39:40,223
A few months ago,

414
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:43,589
he promised me store space beside
the casino if I helped him out.

415
00:39:45,228 --> 00:39:47,694
Then mother won't have to work
in the market.

416
00:39:47,828 --> 00:39:49,692
And you took that at face value,
huh?

417
00:39:49,829 --> 00:39:53,785
Let it go, will ya?
He's your older brother god sakes.

418
00:39:57,832 --> 00:40:01,196
So, how could you help
Pil-ho out with?

419
00:40:03,733 --> 00:40:06,791
When talk started of a casino
or other,

420
00:40:06,934 --> 00:40:10,299
cops hunkered down
on all of Pil-ho's boys.

421
00:40:12,135 --> 00:40:15,261
With my job being a teacher
to a lot of them,

422
00:40:16,704 --> 00:40:18,863
and Pil-ho having to make a living...

423
00:40:20,504 --> 00:40:22,868
I gave him names
of some fresh faces.

424
00:40:24,206 --> 00:40:25,967
He came to me for my help.

425
00:40:28,907 --> 00:40:31,568
When'd you start shooting up, huh?

426
00:40:31,708 --> 00:40:32,765
Did he know you were on it?

427
00:40:32,908 --> 00:40:34,272
Hey!

428
00:40:34,408 --> 00:40:36,671
Is that all you know of your brother?

429
00:40:40,509 --> 00:40:42,067
I ended up like this...

430
00:40:43,311 --> 00:40:48,745
after all the thank you
visits he made.

431
00:40:55,681 --> 00:40:58,545
Looking like this
who's going to listen to me?

432
00:41:01,782 --> 00:41:03,248
That bastard!

433
00:41:07,784 --> 00:41:10,666
<i>The Youth Federation
chairman knows well</i>

434
00:41:10,667 --> 00:41:13,548
<i>the work Pil-ho and
Wang-jae were doing.</i>

435
00:41:18,687 --> 00:41:20,153
Brother!

436
00:41:20,288 --> 00:41:22,811
Who in the world moves in
the middle of the night?

437
00:41:22,955 --> 00:41:24,421
The night's cool! No traffic!

438
00:41:24,556 --> 00:41:25,817
Can't a man move when he wants?

439
00:41:25,955 --> 00:41:28,514
Call this fresh air?
It's damn freezing out here!

440
00:41:28,657 --> 00:41:30,123
This here's hot chocolate season!

441
00:41:30,658 --> 00:41:33,419
Tell me what happened between
Wang-jae and Pil-ho?

442
00:41:33,558 --> 00:41:34,819
Don't know! Out of my way!

443
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:43,023
Cooperate and it'll be easy on you.

444
00:41:45,161 --> 00:41:50,118
If delivery came only a bit sooner,
lazy bums.

445
00:42:16,637 --> 00:42:21,696
After Wang-jae passed over
reigns to Pil-ho,

446
00:42:24,939 --> 00:42:27,099
the whole place became a mess.

447
00:42:28,307 --> 00:42:32,263
Wang-jae might have gotten his
start

448
00:42:32,408 --> 00:42:35,068
as a wise guy but he knew
how to run things.

449
00:42:35,209 --> 00:42:40,575
But Pil-ho's just a thug,
he didn't know left from right.

450
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:43,370
Place was nice and quiet then.

451
00:42:43,511 --> 00:42:44,670
How many times is this now, heh?

452
00:42:44,810 --> 00:42:48,869
<i>Pil-ho then threw everything</i>
<i>up-side-down</i>

453
00:42:49,012 --> 00:42:52,467
Sukhwan, you collected for him
so you should know.

454
00:42:54,013 --> 00:42:55,275
Let me go!

455
00:43:05,283 --> 00:43:09,649
<i>When the hot springs stopped</i>
<i>doing well,</i>

456
00:43:09,785 --> 00:43:13,548
<i>the town was already dying</i>
<i>with nothing but bones and no meat,</i>

457
00:43:16,087 --> 00:43:21,043
- Move it! Get them out of here!
<i>- that's when all hell broke loose</i>

458
00:43:21,688 --> 00:43:23,950
<i>In other words, that's</i>
<i>when opportunity came knocking.</i>

459
00:43:28,590 --> 00:43:33,251
<i>Things picked up real quick,</i>
<i>and then talk traveled fast</i>

460
00:43:33,391 --> 00:43:36,824
<i>that the casino will be letting</i>
<i>in everybody...</i>

461
00:43:36,959 --> 00:43:38,619
Things are really heating up here
with all this about building a casino.

462
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:40,624
So it's this area here.

463
00:43:40,761 --> 00:43:45,421
<i>And Pil-ho too came around</i>
<i>for a scoop.</i>

464
00:43:48,162 --> 00:43:54,028
<i>But the problems started</i>
<i>with a Mr. Jo.</i>

465
00:43:54,664 --> 00:43:57,824
<i>Casino operators they were</i>
<i>from Seoul</i>

466
00:43:57,965 --> 00:44:02,524
<i>On condition Pil-ho looks</i>
<i>after local matters,</i>

467
00:44:02,666 --> 00:44:05,030
<i>they apparently offered him</i>
<i>a partnership.</i>

468
00:44:11,235 --> 00:44:15,192
<i>That's when Pil-ho started</i>
<i>loan sharking with funds</i>

469
00:44:15,337 --> 00:44:20,498
<i>he got from the people</i>
<i>from Seoul.</i>

470
00:44:23,338 --> 00:44:27,397
<i>It's as if all the worst fears came</i>
<i>true.</i>

471
00:44:29,939 --> 00:44:37,204
<i>When the situation finally came</i>
<i>to that,</i>

472
00:44:37,342 --> 00:44:40,605
<i>who are the people going to</i>
<i>look up to if not Wang-jae?</i>

473
00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:44,676
<i>That's also the last time</i>
<i>I saw him.</i>

474
00:44:46,712 --> 00:44:50,577
Why don't you say
something brother? Heh?

475
00:44:50,713 --> 00:44:52,770
This for the public good.

476
00:44:53,814 --> 00:44:58,577
Wang-jae, you're taking this
all wrong.

477
00:44:58,715 --> 00:45:02,080
I received help from Mr. Jang, too.

478
00:45:02,216 --> 00:45:04,682
That's why you're a problem, too.

479
00:45:05,216 --> 00:45:07,479
There's a problem
and we're looking the other way.

480
00:45:07,618 --> 00:45:10,482
Because we're hoping for something
to trickle down?

481
00:45:10,618 --> 00:45:15,144
Problem, what problem?
It's for the greatest good!

482
00:45:15,287 --> 00:45:17,048
Stop what you're doing.

483
00:45:17,187 --> 00:45:20,847
The whole town's a mess
because of you.

484
00:45:22,189 --> 00:45:24,245
Even for a wise guy,

485
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:27,049
there's things you can and cannot
suckle on.

486
00:45:27,190 --> 00:45:29,247
What are you a leech?

487
00:45:29,390 --> 00:45:31,652
Sucking blood from this guy
and that guy?

488
00:45:35,192 --> 00:45:40,455
Hey, that's a bit harsh, no?

489
00:45:42,193 --> 00:45:44,057
I'm your own wife's brother!

490
00:45:44,194 --> 00:45:48,128
Hey! It's Wang-jae you're talking to,
Oh Wang-jae!

491
00:45:48,263 --> 00:45:52,128
What's with you guys?
This a classy joint we're in.

492
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:03,626
Bring some duct tape
if you have any.

493
00:46:11,068 --> 00:46:13,933
This brings back fun memories, heh?

494
00:46:15,169 --> 00:46:17,534
Won't be fun in a while!

495
00:46:18,471 --> 00:46:20,528
You're making a mistake.

496
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:23,399
Mistake was yours.

497
00:46:23,539 --> 00:46:27,098
But you can save yourself of
more than just a rough ride.

498
00:46:29,339 --> 00:46:31,397
Peel and feast on it.

499
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:18,083
Still got no idea about
the grave you're digging?

500
00:47:20,721 --> 00:47:25,984
Keep it up and you'll not only lose

501
00:47:26,123 --> 00:47:35,354
the people's, but your own shirt
as well.

502
00:47:48,094 --> 00:47:50,857
Did Pil-ho then take out Wang-jae?

503
00:47:52,797 --> 00:47:55,456
I said that's as far as I know.

504
00:47:57,798 --> 00:48:00,764
But that Pil-ho isn't someone

505
00:48:02,966 --> 00:48:04,728
to be deterred so easily!

506
00:48:05,967 --> 00:48:08,433
You've no right
to be cussing out Pil-ho

507
00:48:08,568 --> 00:48:12,024
since you set the stage for the kill

508
00:48:12,169 --> 00:48:13,829
I'm a victim, too!

509
00:48:13,969 --> 00:48:16,731
Nobody made you use
other people's money for wager.

510
00:48:16,870 --> 00:48:19,735
I didn't know Pil-ho'd treat me
like this.

511
00:48:24,172 --> 00:48:26,435
We were partners, him and me.

512
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:33,132
How much of this did you know?

513
00:48:33,275 --> 00:48:35,399
First time I'm hearing this.

514
00:48:35,541 --> 00:48:37,405
But you ran for Pil-ho.

515
00:48:37,542 --> 00:48:39,202
I didn't know.

516
00:48:39,343 --> 00:48:41,809
Didn't even know my own brother
turned into a junkie.

517
00:48:45,945 --> 00:48:47,104
Yeah?

518
00:49:05,650 --> 00:49:09,879
Stupid punk!
There's all kinds I'm telling you.

519
00:49:10,618 --> 00:49:13,085
Let me do him.
Hey, lift your head!

520
00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:14,776
Hey, lift your head!

521
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:21,480
Let me go! Stupid idiot!

522
00:49:23,222 --> 00:49:24,688
Just let me kick this kid's ass!

523
00:49:24,822 --> 00:49:26,083
Hey!

524
00:49:26,223 --> 00:49:32,283
Snap out of it!
It's Pil-ho we're after! Huh?

525
00:49:51,096 --> 00:49:56,655
You can give a statement
at the station

526
00:49:56,798 --> 00:49:58,958
if I guarantee your safety, right?

527
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:08,755
It's late.

528
00:50:11,202 --> 00:50:15,430
I, uhm, feel...
embarrassed to face you.

529
00:50:17,070 --> 00:50:21,629
I'm beat, so just get to the point.

530
00:50:25,173 --> 00:50:31,437
During Ma's 60th birthday party
tomorrow,

531
00:50:31,574 --> 00:50:35,029
can you treat me like your older
brother then?

532
00:50:35,875 --> 00:50:38,740
You know it's not for me or
anything.

533
00:50:39,675 --> 00:50:41,437
Out of consideration for Ma.

534
00:50:42,877 --> 00:50:46,332
Her first born son, a weakling

535
00:50:46,478 --> 00:50:48,308
outside and inside the house.

536
00:51:07,451 --> 00:51:10,509
Have any idea what time it is?

537
00:51:24,322 --> 00:51:26,379
Came to play the bad drunk?

538
00:51:27,823 --> 00:51:28,982
Leave!

539
00:51:29,924 --> 00:51:31,686
Ah, fuck it.

540
00:51:36,525 --> 00:51:41,891
Can't visit the house of my only
friend whenever the hell I want?

541
00:51:42,027 --> 00:51:44,187
Why are you doing this to me?

542
00:51:47,629 --> 00:51:49,993
Why? Why?

543
00:51:51,230 --> 00:51:54,560
Did you ask me why?
Ah, fuck it.

544
00:51:58,697 --> 00:52:00,664
Miran!

545
00:52:00,798 --> 00:52:02,162
Ms. Jang Miran!

546
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:06,860
Your husband Wang-jae...

547
00:52:07,001 --> 00:52:07,967
It was your older brother,

548
00:52:08,101 --> 00:52:10,660
It was your older brother,
Pil-ho killed him.

549
00:52:16,303 --> 00:52:18,065
My friend Wang-jae,

550
00:52:19,104 --> 00:52:21,662
my friend Pil-ho killed him!

551
00:52:31,774 --> 00:52:34,240
I told you,
you were making a mistake.

552
00:52:36,175 --> 00:52:38,232
Jang Pil-ho, you...

553
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:53,144
Hey, asshole!
You didn't keep your word.

554
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:55,611
You said you'd take care of my sister.

555
00:52:55,612 --> 00:52:57,941
Look at the mess you're in now, huh?

556
00:53:21,855 --> 00:53:24,015
Ah, man...

557
00:53:24,155 --> 00:53:27,020
Situation is getting
progressively worse.

558
00:53:31,556 --> 00:53:35,490
So? What do you
propose should be done?

559
00:53:36,426 --> 00:53:38,584
Given the importance of the matter,

560
00:53:38,725 --> 00:53:41,591
I suggest the matter be dealt with

561
00:53:41,727 --> 00:53:43,284
before word reaches Seoul.

562
00:53:45,627 --> 00:53:50,085
Baldheaded sir!
Just one phone call!

563
00:53:50,728 --> 00:53:52,490
Please? It's real urgent.
I'm telling you.

564
00:53:52,629 --> 00:53:56,791
Just let me charge my cell phone.
Darn that cop!

565
00:53:56,931 --> 00:53:58,089
Sir!

566
00:54:04,333 --> 00:54:09,063
Hey mister!
My neck's on the line!

567
00:54:09,201 --> 00:54:10,757
Keep it down, I said!

568
00:54:10,901 --> 00:54:12,561
They're coming for me!

569
00:54:14,202 --> 00:54:15,361
I mean...

570
00:54:23,306 --> 00:54:26,761
- What the?
- Hey mister! My neck's on the line!

571
00:54:26,906 --> 00:54:30,669
What's this? Ain't this gasoline?

572
00:54:32,608 --> 00:54:34,574
What the fuck he's doing!

573
00:54:40,310 --> 00:54:41,436
Help!

574
00:55:05,583 --> 00:55:07,447
Spare me!

575
00:55:10,284 --> 00:55:12,342
Spare me!

576
00:55:13,185 --> 00:55:15,118
Please spare me!

577
00:55:17,653 --> 00:55:23,917
Spare me! Please spare me!

578
00:55:26,456 --> 00:55:31,617
I said nothing.
You gotta believe me, please.

579
00:55:38,159 --> 00:55:40,820
Help! Please, help!

580
00:55:46,062 --> 00:55:47,578
Jung Tae-soo here.

581
00:56:04,346 --> 00:56:06,505
Get the mix with sand just, right?

582
00:56:07,446 --> 00:56:11,310
Screw ups with the ratios are
what's behind the collapse

583
00:56:11,446 --> 00:56:13,708
of bridges and buildings,
irresponsible bastards!

584
00:56:15,045 --> 00:56:17,102
Brother try wiggling your toes a bit.

585
00:56:17,646 --> 00:56:18,804
Feel alright?

586
00:56:20,445 --> 00:56:22,468
It's all rock solid dry now.

587
00:56:29,411 --> 00:56:32,969
See how I always look out
for your interest?

588
00:56:34,411 --> 00:56:39,070
But you never gave me
any credit for that!

589
00:56:41,411 --> 00:56:43,274
Did I or didn't I tell you to stay put

590
00:56:43,411 --> 00:56:44,671
till I get things ready huh?

591
00:56:44,811 --> 00:56:48,072
Am I one to hog your land?

592
00:56:49,811 --> 00:56:53,470
Am I not one to let you reclaim it
later on?

593
00:56:54,977 --> 00:56:59,034
I just don't get it.

594
00:56:59,177 --> 00:57:00,836
Wanting so much without

595
00:57:00,977 --> 00:57:02,841
making any sacrifices.

596
00:57:05,576 --> 00:57:06,736
You're a traitor.

597
00:57:14,977 --> 00:57:16,840
In any case, no more after today.

598
00:57:19,876 --> 00:57:24,830
I say again but I did nothing wrong.

599
00:57:25,977 --> 00:57:28,908
We're here because
brother took things too far.

600
00:57:31,942 --> 00:57:33,703
You poor.

601
00:57:35,442 --> 00:57:38,307
Alright, pass on my best regards
to Wang-jae.

602
00:57:41,342 --> 00:57:44,706
Wow! Ma traveled back
in a time machine.

603
00:57:44,842 --> 00:57:48,001
That's just
because you won't grow up.

604
00:57:48,542 --> 00:57:51,303
Good enough for the movies then,

605
00:57:51,442 --> 00:57:53,499
There'd be no bigger star
next to me.

606
00:57:53,642 --> 00:57:55,903
You're gleaming
because of the great dress.

607
00:57:56,041 --> 00:58:00,598
Donghwan picked out for you.

608
00:58:00,741 --> 00:58:03,263
But we gotta get going
if we're picking up aunt.

609
00:58:03,407 --> 00:58:04,567
Alright!

610
00:59:19,738 --> 00:59:20,999
Remember this?

611
00:59:22,338 --> 00:59:25,203
Still ways left for 20 years,

612
00:59:26,538 --> 00:59:28,094
but with one gone already.

613
00:59:28,837 --> 00:59:31,997
Looks like one of us
isn't gonna make it either.

614
00:59:32,937 --> 00:59:34,197
Got the green light.

615
00:59:35,438 --> 00:59:38,801
Brought it thinking there'll
be no other chance to talk.

616
00:59:38,937 --> 00:59:41,664
Ma, all this here used to be
farmland.

617
00:59:41,804 --> 00:59:43,565
I can't believe it.

618
00:59:43,704 --> 00:59:47,966
Wouldn't have sold the land
had I known this'd happen.

619
00:59:48,103 --> 00:59:50,661
But boy, it's a nice day today.

620
00:59:50,804 --> 00:59:52,463
Still didn't go back, huh?

621
00:59:54,403 --> 00:59:56,266
Planning to go back with you.

622
00:59:56,903 --> 00:59:59,869
There's a lot left for me to do here.

623
01:00:00,302 --> 01:00:03,167
How many more people's gotta get
hurt?

624
01:00:03,303 --> 01:00:05,269
This is your own hometown, man.

625
01:00:05,403 --> 01:00:07,868
Long time since I changed
my address.

626
01:00:08,003 --> 01:00:10,060
Stop joking around and stop it.

627
01:00:10,203 --> 01:00:11,463
You know?

628
01:00:12,003 --> 01:00:16,025
You guys tried to boss me around
since we were kids.

629
01:00:16,169 --> 01:00:18,431
We didn't try, we did boss you!

630
01:00:24,469 --> 01:00:27,923
Taesoo, Jung Taesoo.

631
01:00:33,069 --> 01:00:34,227
Ok.

632
01:00:44,968 --> 01:00:51,298
If you've got time,
let's go to the sauna.

633
01:01:04,734 --> 01:01:08,097
Say, think you can hack it?

634
01:01:11,434 --> 01:01:12,797
You know what?

635
01:01:13,933 --> 01:01:17,990
I know it's cheesy to kiss ass,

636
01:01:18,133 --> 01:01:22,361
but it's worse to not give credit
where it's due.

637
01:01:24,999 --> 01:01:28,864
Staring at me? What? What?

638
01:01:29,199 --> 01:01:30,563
Drunk in anger?

639
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:32,962
Burns real hot inside?

640
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:37,259
Kills ya you're helpless
to an old pushover, huh?

641
01:01:38,199 --> 01:01:40,960
Can't even die
if you don't got the grit.

642
01:01:48,898 --> 01:01:52,161
I'm not going to kill you.
Know why?

643
01:01:53,599 --> 01:01:55,428
You're too much below me.

644
01:01:57,065 --> 01:02:00,828
Isn't forgiveness too a quality
of the strong?

645
01:02:03,464 --> 01:02:06,828
You know? That's real forgiveness.
The strong forgiving the weak.

646
01:02:10,965 --> 01:02:14,920
Know what Taesoo?

647
01:02:16,164 --> 01:02:20,120
It's not the strong who lasts,
but the one that lasts who's strong.

648
01:02:36,030 --> 01:02:37,689
For your ride up!

649
01:02:46,330 --> 01:02:48,693
If you leave him like that,
there's an element of danger.

650
01:02:48,829 --> 01:02:51,091
Should the opening be closed?

651
01:02:54,429 --> 01:02:56,089
Who the hell are you?

652
01:02:59,629 --> 01:03:02,958
I'm the judge and the jury.

653
01:03:03,095 --> 01:03:04,857
I'm the king, damn it!

654
01:05:15,856 --> 01:05:18,721
I'm leaving for Seoul tomorrow.

655
01:05:20,357 --> 01:05:21,617
Oh, yeah?

656
01:05:24,656 --> 01:05:29,419
What do you want me to do?
There's nothing I can do!

657
01:05:32,957 --> 01:05:36,218
One's my brother
and the other my husband.

658
01:05:46,755 --> 01:05:51,380
Heard there's a gathering tonight at
Ondangjung of the casino people.

659
01:06:22,088 --> 01:06:23,553
Hello.

660
01:06:23,688 --> 01:06:25,153
It's me Sukhwan.

661
01:06:26,588 --> 01:06:31,350
Funeral for your mother
and brother go well?

662
01:06:31,486 --> 01:06:33,952
State of things for bade me
from attending.

663
01:06:34,087 --> 01:06:35,848
Did send a fat envelope though.

664
01:06:36,186 --> 01:06:38,448
It's your heart that's important.

665
01:06:38,587 --> 01:06:40,052
It's all war from now.

666
01:06:41,387 --> 01:06:43,944
Something piss you off?

667
01:06:44,087 --> 01:06:46,246
Stop it you scaring me.

668
01:06:46,386 --> 01:06:48,250
But what am I gonna do?

669
01:06:48,387 --> 01:06:53,444
Oh shucks, real busy though tonight
with all the Seoul boys in town.

670
01:06:54,853 --> 01:06:56,614
It's no problem.

671
01:06:56,753 --> 01:06:59,014
We don't care much about time
and place.

672
01:07:13,052 --> 01:07:18,712
Had Donghwan really become
a judge,

673
01:07:18,851 --> 01:07:21,715
he sure would've watched
our backs, huh?

674
01:07:22,952 --> 01:07:26,407
Hey, I may not have a warrant...

675
01:07:28,018 --> 01:07:29,881
but this is at least half legal.

676
01:07:30,918 --> 01:07:32,975
What?

677
01:08:03,483 --> 01:08:06,938
Hey, where's this Jang Pil-ho?

678
01:09:13,314 --> 01:09:14,473
Cheers!

679
01:09:52,579 --> 01:09:55,045
What's all this noise?

680
01:09:55,978 --> 01:09:57,343
Don't worry about it.

681
01:09:57,479 --> 01:10:02,036
Noise is normal in a place like this.

682
01:10:17,344 --> 01:10:20,504
How ya doing? Feel alright?

683
01:10:20,644 --> 01:10:22,405
Running low on gas.

684
01:10:24,344 --> 01:10:26,606
But you got less mileage on ya.

685
01:10:27,544 --> 01:10:32,306
Heh? The hurt don't discriminate
between the old and young.

686
01:10:35,344 --> 01:10:37,003
I'm busy, catch up with ya later.

687
01:10:37,944 --> 01:10:39,103
Ok.

688
01:10:52,310 --> 01:10:54,173
When the job here is done,

689
01:10:54,310 --> 01:10:57,572
you must take some main office
work and help build the organization.

690
01:10:59,109 --> 01:11:02,871
Your hometown's a tourist city...

691
01:11:03,009 --> 01:11:06,873
It's time you shed
your backward image.

692
01:11:16,109 --> 01:11:20,837
I would like to introduce you
to the chairman.

693
01:11:20,976 --> 01:11:25,839
But you're still a little rough
around the edges.

694
01:11:26,576 --> 01:11:29,632
Wonder if that's because you've
done nothing but field work.

695
01:11:30,775 --> 01:11:36,730
I still don't think you fully
appreciate what real business is.

696
01:15:50,198 --> 01:15:51,256
Who's that?

697
01:15:51,399 --> 01:15:53,261
Noise is because of them two?

698
01:15:54,298 --> 01:15:58,060
You disappoint me, Mr. Jang.

699
01:16:09,096 --> 01:16:13,153
Though I did start knowing that
I'd be working with a bunch of hicks,

700
01:16:14,597 --> 01:16:17,461
How can I work losing face like this?

701
01:16:58,428 --> 01:17:00,690
Hell of a big mouth, Asshole.

702
01:17:02,128 --> 01:17:05,788
What? What?

703
01:17:08,727 --> 01:17:11,592
What? This guy?

704
01:17:13,628 --> 01:17:17,287
He's not the chairman or anything.
Shit.

705
01:17:17,427 --> 01:17:21,189
This ain't changing anything
for you or me.

706
01:17:34,993 --> 01:17:39,050
Skinny cowards.
Not taking leftovers here?

707
01:17:54,293 --> 01:17:55,452
Hey, Taesoo.

708
01:17:57,193 --> 01:18:01,024
I lose cuz of you. Driving me nuts.

709
01:18:01,559 --> 01:18:07,322
You breaking my balls hanging
around here, heh?

710
01:18:10,458 --> 01:18:14,515
Come on and have a drink.

711
01:18:14,659 --> 01:18:16,318
Pretty good eats here.

712
01:23:28,647 --> 01:23:31,612
You got good teeth both of you.

713
01:23:32,512 --> 01:23:37,172
Life throws all kinds at ya,
but no need

714
01:23:37,313 --> 01:23:44,472
to dive head first into everything,

715
01:23:46,213 --> 01:23:47,178
right?

716
01:23:47,312 --> 01:23:50,176
Jang Pil-ho, you bastard!

717
01:24:22,877 --> 01:24:25,156
How is it, something hot in your body?

718
01:24:25,157 --> 01:24:27,434
Feels like something's poking?

719
01:24:28,577 --> 01:24:30,440
It's all like that the first time.

720
01:24:35,476 --> 01:24:38,931
Why you always trying to make me
the bad guy?

721
01:24:39,443 --> 01:24:40,703
What?

722
01:24:41,343 --> 01:24:45,002
Wang-jae and you,
why you guys always put me down?

723
01:24:46,843 --> 01:24:48,104
Jealous?

724
01:24:49,442 --> 01:24:52,307
Getting jealous because
your punch bag has sidestepped

725
01:24:52,442 --> 01:24:55,806
you and been crowned king?

726
01:24:55,943 --> 01:24:57,101
Huh?

727
01:25:00,543 --> 01:25:02,202
Fuck it.

728
01:25:07,042 --> 01:25:12,372
Hey, Pil-ho!
How'd we end up like this...

729
01:25:12,508 --> 01:25:13,769
There's nothing between us...

730
01:25:27,108 --> 01:25:28,472
Hey, Pil-ho.

731
01:25:29,408 --> 01:25:31,965
You can never know...

732
01:25:34,308 --> 01:25:38,467
but the winner is
the last one standing...

733
01:25:38,607 --> 01:25:39,766
Hey, Pil-ho.

734
01:25:51,574 --> 01:25:52,834
Hey, Pil-ho.

735
01:25:55,374 --> 01:26:00,329
I remember your hands,
they were always warm, heh?

736
01:27:02,803 --> 01:27:05,861
But technically speaking,
didn't we win?

737
01:27:07,104 --> 01:27:08,865
Donghwan, what do you think?

738
01:27:09,803 --> 01:27:12,668
They did the wrong stuff,

739
01:27:12,804 --> 01:27:15,963
and we beat 'em in actual practice
as well.

740
01:27:16,603 --> 01:27:19,069
They're stinking bums anyway.

741
01:27:21,903 --> 01:27:24,870
Whole days gone and we
got nothing to show for it.

742
01:27:25,769 --> 01:27:31,134
Whatcha mean?
We got this bottle to show for it.

743
01:27:31,770 --> 01:27:37,225
We make it big and in about
20 years we drink it in style.

744
01:27:38,370 --> 01:27:42,632
Wonder what we'll be doing then.

745
01:27:42,968 --> 01:27:45,935
Ah, don't fret about it.

746
01:27:46,069 --> 01:27:49,432
Ain't gonna be a walk
in the park anyway.

747
01:27:49,569 --> 01:27:51,727
What are you, bitch!

748
01:28:22,134 --> 01:28:24,293
Fuck it.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.moviesubtitles.org</font>


9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.moviesubtitles.org</font>
